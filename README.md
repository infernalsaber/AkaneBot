## Run Locally


### Prerequisites
Before you start, you'll need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the proper permissions:
- `applications.commands`
- `bot` (with Send Messages enabled)


Configuring the app is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

Note: Remember to enable the text messages intent as it's required for prefix commands

### Setup project

First clone the project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/infernalsaber/AkaneBot.git
```

Open the directory and run
```
$ mv .example.env .env
```

Now put your Discord Bot Token and [SauceNAO Token](https://saucenao.com/) in the `.env` file

### Install dependencies

Do
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To install the dependencies

If you plan to modify the source code, do the same for `requirements_dev.txt`

If you're an active python developer, might want to create a [virtual environment first](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)


### Run the app

You're all set up now.

Run the following to get the bot running
```
$ python -OO main.py
```


Btw: <br>
i. replacing the owner id with your own would be a good idea <br>
ii. the emotes will break on your instance, so do replace them with equivalent ones
